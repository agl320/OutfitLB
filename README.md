# OutfitLB
Keeps track of clean and dirty clothing, as well as providing an ability to create outfits.

Features:
- Custom class hierarchy: Accounts (database) > User profiles > Closets, Clothing, and Outfits
- Stores Clothing (Top, Bottom, Shoes) in Closets
- Clothing can be grouped up together to create Outfits
- Both Clothing and Outfits interact when one becomes dirty/clean
- Local and online storage for User configs with hashing authentication (WIP)
- Changing to CustomTkinter for more modern UI (WIP)

Run with `py .\main.py`
